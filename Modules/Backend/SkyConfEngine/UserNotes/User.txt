Hello there user! I see you are taking a peak at the source code behind SLC! Before doing so here are a few things to keep in mind

-- SLC Current state 

The SkyLine Configuration language is currently in beta and in testing but still able to be used. Given that the source code is experimental 
it is highly suggested that you do not mess or change this source code without first looking at the technical documents of the engine itself.
This is so you at least know what the engine's purpose is as well as why it exists.

--- SLC's Core Modules 

SLC's current state of its modular activity and setting is all mashed into one due to how lightweight the engine is.
There is no need to push direct modules or remote modules onto the engine because the point of the engine is to be very very 
simple, very flexible and extremely fluid while also having the most simplistic syntax and performance avalible to also boost project 
development. Modules are all mashed into one directory due to its size and testing reasons as well as modular import reasons.
