# SkyLine | By hackers for hackers

SkyLine is a programming language tailored directly to cyber security related fields and mathematics. Being written out of the Go programming language, skyline plans to be one of the more performant interpreted programming languages that can boost you during your project development. It is important to note that while this is SkyLine's direct plan, the language itself is not directly prepared and in `0.0.5` of SkyLine, it is still in testing and is not even close to beta yet. We urge you to isolate SkyLine in a non production based environment during its use case.


# UNDER DEVELOPMENT - COME BACK LATER
